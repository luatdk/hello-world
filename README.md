Hi there,

I am a new immigrant of United States since 12/2015. Now, I'm trying the best to adapt with a new life in U.S.

One of the first thing is I am now working in a electric/computer company as a technician. I am also spending time to learn courses on Coursera as well as other IT certificates, such as MCSA or CompTIA.

Sincerely,
